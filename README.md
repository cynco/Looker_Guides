# Looker_Guides
Guides to get up and running with Looker!

These files can be edited by contributors so that we can make these guides ever more useful and comprehensive.

SQL code will be colored appropriately. 

Comments should be prepended with "--" or "//"

Elements that are highly encouraged are: 
    - actual SQL code that worked for you
    - Resy-related examples in the explanations
    - warnings about any nuances you encountered
    - Links to helpful resources (no need to re-write something that's already well explained elsewhere)
